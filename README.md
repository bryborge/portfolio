# Portfolio

This is my portfolio app.
It is a NextJS application and was bootstrapped using [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Prerequisites

*   nodenv (optional)
*   NodeJS
*   Docker

## Getting Started

1.  `npm install`
2.  `npm run dev`

You could also use Docker to spin up the application locally, though it is generally a nicer, faster experience to work
on the application natively on your development machine.


Now, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

## Testing

TODO: Add test suite

## Deployment

This project uses [Github Workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows) to deploy as a static website
against the `main` branch.
