Reframe your regret as grief.

If you do that, it becomes actionable.
Regret is a waste of energy.
Grief however, when engaged with, is an investment opportunity in the process of healing!

When you are *with* your grief, you can mourn.
And when you mourn, you are in the well positioned to practice feeling deeply and extending grace to yourself.
Then, at last, you can accept your past and heal.

If extending grace to yourself is a new concept or idea to you, you're not alone.
I didn't know that was even an option (and frankly, I initially rejected the notion because I didn't trust that I was capable of "me-directed" kindness, and patterns of self-deprecation run deep).

From one student of life to all others, be well.
